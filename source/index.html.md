# Introduction

Drift Protocol is an open-sourced, decentralised exchange built on the Solana blockchain, enabling transparent and non-custodial trading on cryptocurrencies.

We have language bindings in [Typescript](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v2/tree/master/sdk) and [Python](https://github.com/drift-labs/driftpy)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This API documentation page is open sourced and available [here](https://github.com/drift-labs/v2-teacher) was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to submit raise [Issues](https://github.com/drift-labs/v2-teacher/issues) or [submit PR](https://github.com/drift-labs/v2-teacher/pulls).

# Authentication
To access and interact with a blockchain, such as Solana, you need a keypair, which consists of a public key and a private key. The private key should be kept secure and not shared with anyone else.

To generate a new keypair, you can use the [Solana Tool Suite](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) by running the following command on the command line:

```javascript
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/my-keypair.json
```

This command will create a new keypair and store it in a JSON file located at ~/.config/solana/my-keypair.json.

To allow SDK code to use this keypair for authentication, you need to set the ANCHOR_WALLET environment variable to the path of the JSON file that contains the keypair. You can do this by running the following command:

```javascript
export ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/my-keypair.json
```

This command sets the ANCHOR_WALLET environment variable to the path of the JSON file that contains your keypair, so that SDK code can access it when needed.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>~/.config/solana/my-keypair.json</code> with your personal key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
